- question: Will I have time for this?
  answer: Yes! Although this is a cohort program, all the material is available for you to study in your own pace. However, if you want the full learning experience, some of the assignments come with a deadline so that we can discuss the learnings in class.

- question: Is it really possible to condense a two year MBA program into a short 8-week program?
  answer: "Yes and No. Some things take time, and you cannot expect to have read as much material in a part-time 8 week program that you would in two years full-time. <br><br> However, when we look back at our own studies at leading MBA programs, a few important experiences stood out as being much more valuable than others while also being time-efficient. As an example, recording one short video of yourself presenting quarterly results will teach your much more than reading 50 theoretical cases on corporate communication, and negotiating an actual deal with someone else will teach you more than reading 10 full books on negotation."

- question: Is the Pareto mini-MBA self-paced or a cohort program?
  answer: It's both. Materials are available for you to study at your own pace, but to maximize learning and to get added value from interactions with other participants, we've included weekly workshops (on Fridays) during which you'll engage in practical exercises and reflect on what you've learnt. We also have office hours on Wednesdays, meaning you can reach out to us with any questions you may have. We're also individually onboarding every single participant to set goals and expectations, and follow up continuously during the program.

- question: Where is Pareto Business School based?
  answer: We are an online business school. Our team is Nordic and American, and our corporate headquarters and legal entity are based in Stockholm, Sweden.

- question: What's the mission and vision of Pareto Business School?
  answer: We are on a mission to democratize business education and help people build better businesses. We want to be the best in the world at curating and teaching business knowledge, tools and techniques online. Pareto is the "intellectual gym" for the busy professional, preparing you for real-life business situations.

- question: Is the Pareto mini-MBA accredited?
  answer: No, the Pareto mini-MBA is not accredited, and this is by design. We want to be an affordable and accessible business program, we don't even see traditional MBA programs as competitors. We do things differently, and, we believe, more efficiently and with an emphasis on practice rather than theory. You will also not receive any ECTS or any other credits when finishing the Pareto mini-MBA, again by design.

- question: Can I get a refund if I'm not satisfied?
  answer: "Yes! All of our students are eligible for a full refund within 15 days of starting the program."
