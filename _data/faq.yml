- question: Will I have time for this?
  answer: Yes! Although this is a cohort program, all the material is available for you to study in your own pace. However, if you want the full learning experience, some of the assignments come with a deadline so that we can discuss the learnings in class.

- question: Is it really possible to condense a two year MBA program into a short 8-week program?
  answer: "Yes and No. Some things take time, and you cannot expect to have read as much material in a part-time 8 week program that you would in two years full-time. <br><br> However, when we look back at our own studies at leading MBA programs, a few important experiences stood out as being much more valuable than others while also being time-efficient. As an example, recording one short video of yourself presenting quarterly results will teach your much more than reading 50 theoretical cases on corporate communication, and negotiating an actual deal with someone else will teach you more than reading 10 full books on negotation."

- question: Is the Pareto MBA accredited?
  answer: No, and this is by design. We want to be an affordable and accessible alternative to an MBA program, which wouldn't be possible with the requirements that come with the accreditation process.

- question: Can I get a refund if I'm not satisfied?
  answer: "Yes! All of our students are eligible for a full refund within 15 days of starting the program."
